        It is rightly said that being disciplined is essential in life. When a person leads a disciplined life,
        they set an casy path to success. They will develop an approach to happiness and a beautiful future
        ahead. Being disciplined is the practice of having a scheduled daily routine which helps an individual
        to be punctual and hard-working. An individual is taught what being disciplined means from the time
        they are young. Even though discipline takes a lot of effort, the advantages of a disciplined life
        make it a worthwhile endeavour.
